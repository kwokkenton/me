          <p class="featured-desc">
            I used web-scraping, to obtain data from the Hong Kong Immigration Department's website
            and analysed time series trends. Through this I gauged the magnitude of the influxes and
            outfluxes of the Hong Kong population in the years 2020-2021.

        <p class="featured-desc">
          Predicting the likelihood of a person having heart failure would be extremely valuable to
          the medical field as early diagnosis would enhance the possibility of sound recovery. An
          XGBoost model was used to model whether a person would suffer from fatal heart failure and
          an F1-score of ~73% was consistently achieved.

            This was a Year 2 Physics Laboratory extension where we experimented with an
            inteferometer, which is an instrument capable of using light to measure lengths on the
            order of its wavelength. I developed an algorithm to correct for the jitter caused by
            mechanical movement of a mirror. This was compared against the known emission spectrum
            of Mercury.

            thermodynamics simulation in the object-oriented-programming regime. 'Measurements' were
            taken inside the program and compared to ideal theoretical predictions.

            Working with my lab partner in the Advanced Electronics course, we used operational

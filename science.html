          <p class="featured-desc">
            I used web-scraping, to obtain data from the Hong Kong Immigration Department's website
            and analysed time series trends. Through this I gauged the magnitude of the influxes and
            outfluxes of the Hong Kong population in the years 2020-2021.

            This was a Year 2 Physics Laboratory extension where we experimented with an
            inteferometer, which is an instrument capable of using light to measure lengths on the
            order of its wavelength. I developed an algorithm to correct for the jitter caused by
            mechanical movement of a mirror. This was compared against the known emission spectrum
            of Mercury.
